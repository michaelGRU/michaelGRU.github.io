<center><h1>Research Notes on Classical Sociological Theory</h1></center>
<div>
    Shouyang Wang <br>
<p>I am broadly interested in classical sociological theories of the 19th and early 20th century intellectuals because the pioneering breakthroughs and innovative ways of thinking set the foundation for later ideas. I believe old-school thoughts are pertinent in today's society, just like physicists would first study Newton's laws before jumping into quantum mechanics and relativity. The sociology knowledge I obtained derives from an online course titled Classical Sociological Theory taught by professor Heerikhuizen. I summarized the content in my own words to reinforce my understanding of the materials and highlighted the relevance to my research on media and social networks. 
</p>
<h2>Karl Marx</h2>
<p>Key ideas: inequality, labor, the concept of class, social consciousness, class conflict theory, revolution, means of production,  historical materialism, economic base and superstructure</p>
<h3>What is the relevance of Marx's theories in my research?</h3>
<p>One of the primary research that I do is regarding media and how to leverage big data generated from digital and social media to study human behaviors and social systems. For instance, we see bias and misinformation everywhere on social media. From a Marxist perspective, one concern is that the "bourgeoisie" controls the mainstream media. To an extent, the information that we see on mainstream media reflects the beliefs of wealthy and influential people. Some powerful individuals can manipulate the information we see and justify the exploitation of the working class via relentless brainwash and social pressure. <br>
    I believe we can reference this model, but we can't wholly adopt it because the world that we live in today is different from the world 100 or 200 years ago. Capitalism has taken a new form, and it does not seem like it's as "damaging" or un-flexible as what Marx described in his time. Another thing to consider is that the concept of class conflict theory is perhaps too simplistic to apply to today's world. It depends highly on the society in question. Still, in most western or eastern countries, people don't identify themselves as simply the bourgeoisie or the proletariat. 
    Marx predicted that a revolution would lead to the collapse of capitalism and transpose the world into a communist society. In this better and friendlier civilization, wealth and resources are distributed equally. Many thinkers would perceive this notion as somewhat of a fairytale. 
    <br> 
    Nevertheless, Marx's revolutionary ideas are still highly relevant today when we look at social systems on a global scale. We see that European capitalists are exploiting workers in Africa and Asia. Many workers in the less developed world are willing to do the job that European workers would not do at a lower price. Many western companies outsource their labor to Asian countries to assemble their products. The capitalist system is flexible enough that it could stretch its lifetime via globalization. However, many followers of Marx would argue that capitalism has reached its final stage as globalization has come to a very mature phase.

<h3>Social Stratification, Consciousness, and Dialectical (Historical) Materialism</h3>
<p>
    One central theme in sociology is social inequality. Social stratification categorizes people into groups or classes from high to low based on their socioeconomic factors. For instance, most societies often associate poverty and a lack of education with a low social status. <br>
    It was Karl Marx who theorized that human beings are the totality of all the social relationships that tie them together. The idea is formulated in his book A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy. He wrote that <br>
    <span>"It is not the consciousness of men that determines their being, but, on the contrary, their social being that determines their consciousness." </span> <br>
    Each human being is a component of a broader network or social system. The social network itself directly impacts how each individual thinks or behaves. This idea is the foundation of many branches of sociological theories. <br>
    Many people characterize Marx as a materialist because of the belief that economic ties determine the ideas of human beings. Marx believed that the most fundamental social networks human beings form are those having to do with survival. For instance, money and food. Other social relationships between people, for example, science, politics, and religion, are secondary to a solid economic base – the production and control of resources. Another way to look at this theory known as historical materialism is that the economic base of society directly determines the superstructure – religion, law, politics, science, arts, etc. It is not that the superstructure is unimportant. It is the belief that the superstructure is built on top of the economic base or material reality. Marx explained to his readers that when we study how well a society functions, we must first focus on the economic factors because a weak foundation would eventually lead to the collapse of the superstructure. <br>
    The belief that economic factors determine the superstructure has deep roots in Marx's philosophy. Marx believed that human beings are, in essence, workers. It is in labor that we develop our talents and find meaning in life. However, Marx was concerned that labor has turned into a commodity. That is, something you can simply buy and sell. Marx distinguished the terms "use value" and "exchange value." The food we purchase, for instance, has a use-value because they satisfy human needs. When human labor is turned into a commodity that we can buy and sell, we are not concerned with the virtue of labor or its use-value but rather how much profit we can gain from this exchange. Marx referred to this defiled way of exchanging labor as the outcome of a process of alienation. Alienation means that an individual is being isolated from a society where they should be involved. Under capitalism, many factory workers labor relentlessly in exchange for money. Their work is mechanical and repetitive, and it shows no craftsmanship. When this happens, workers don't recognize their creations because they only care about the exchanged money obtained from labor. Marx believed that men realize their deepest potentials via labor. When the work is meaningless, a man's life is pointless. Marx argued that alienation not only separates a worker from other people within the society but also separates a human from their true self. When a person does repetitive and mechanical labor that has no meaning, they are stripped of their humanity. <br>
    <h3>Conflict Theory</h3>
    <p>Marx wrote in the Communist Manifesto that "the history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles." For human society to survive, humans must work together to change the natural world to fit our needs. Working together is via a process called "labor," and we must labor cooperatively. As we labor, we gradually free ourselves from natural constraints. However, as we free ourselves from natural constraints, we entangle ourselves in social rules. In a primitive communist society, humans are limited by natural conditions but are socially equal. In a Feudalism society, the higher class (the nobility) flourish. In contrast, the lower class (the peasantry) suffers due to unequal social redistribution.<br>
    
        Marx reasoned that human society comprises different classes that compete over scarce resources, and conflicts between classes drive societal change. Two main classes remain intact under industrial capitalism: the working class (proletariat) and the capitalists (bourgeoisie). The bourgeoisie is a minority group, but the group has the power within the society, and they own the resources most people needed. The working class depends on the capitalists to get paid in return for their labor. As we can observe here, there is a significant economic and resource inequality between the two classes. Capitalists own the means of production. In layman's terms, capitalists own the materials the working class needs to produce goods via labor. The materials include factories, lands, resources, tools, and machines, etc. The working class, on the other hand, owns nothing and is forced to labor to survive. <br>
        The conflict between the proletariat and bourgeoisie is the central conflict in industrial capitalist society because the scarce resources are not fairly distributed. When a proletariat is paid less than what the proletariat produced, the system creates a surplus or profit. Marx reasoned that the bourgeoisie makes its profit by exploiting the members of the working class. The bourgeoisie lives off the surplus value that they extract from the working class, and they will always try to maximize the surplus, which leads to a crisis of overproduction. The intuition is that over labor generates more than what is needed. However, the vast majority of people in the working class could not afford to buy the products or enjoy the benefits of the surplus created by their labor. When this happens, the economic collapse and conflicts between classes exacerbate. As the working class realizes that they were being exploited, workers will unite to create a class consciousness. A revolution started by the oppressed people will eventually drive societal change.

<h2>Emile Durkheim</h2>
<p>Key ideas: formation of collective consciousness, organic versus mechanical solidarity, suicide, social integration, social functions of religion </p>
<h3>What is the relevance of Durkheim's theories?</h3>
<p>The level of connection on social media is a lot weaker than the traditional physical connection. Studies found that modern-day suicide can be linked to the usage of the Internet and social media. Durkheim wrote that egoistic suicide is caused by a gradual lowering of social cohesion. The superficial bond people form online gives people a sense of alienation. (I think this is relevant to Marx's theory of alienation due to modernity and modern lifestyle.) The addictive nature of the Internet also indirectly makes it difficult for people to bond with friends and families in real life. When people feel isolated and not connected with other members of society in a meaningful way, the suicide tendency will increase. (Marx would argue that the process of alienation will strip “a person's humanity.”) <br>
    On top of that, social media can be highly unpredictable as there is a mixture of fake and real news. We can observe a diverse set of opinions and facts on social media that a person may find hard to swallow. </p>

<h3>Social Facts, Suicide as a Social Problem, Structural Functionalism</h3>
<p>According to Durkheim, sociology is the study of social facts. Social facts are external to an individual. Some examples of social facts are moral rules, religious dogmas, laws, class structure, institutions, etc. Society exerts a strong force on individuals, and people's beliefs and values make up a collective consciousness to view the world. It was Durkheim who formally introduced sociology as an academic discipline to solve social problems that are typical of modernity.<br>
    Durkheim reasoned that suicide seems to be a personal act rather than a social action. However, when we look at society as a whole, we can see that suicide is a social phenomenon. Researchers can predict the number of suicide cases based on year, politics, religion, region, culture, and other socioeconomic factors. There is a strong correlation between societal structure and suicide. He did quantitative studies on suicide to prove that suicide rates have nothing to do with the mental illness of specific individuals, genetics, or depression in the family. An individual event as suicide can be explained sociologically. Durkheim reasoned that a lack of social integration causes people to commit suicide.<br>Durkheim argued a strong relationship between suicide rates and socioeconomic factors, such as religion, marital status, and a person's economic position. Durkheim believed that a weak social tie leads to higher suicide rates. For instance, the suicide rate for married couples is lower than the rates for singles. Singles are bound with weaker ties to society. Similarly, the social cohesion amongst the Jews is higher than atheists. Hence, it is more likely for non-believers to commit suicide. <br>
    Egoistic suicide is caused by a gradual lowering of social cohesion.<br>
    Altruistic Suicide – A soldier sacrifices his life for the greater interests of a nation. This happens when the social cohesion is too strong. In other words, the soldier could not separate himself from their country. <br>
    Anomie means a lack of rules or guidance for an individual to follow. For instance, we can observe a rise in suicide rates amongst groups that suffer from economic uncertainties. <br>
    Fatalistic suicide – this happens when the regulation is too high. <br>
    Durkheim imagined society as a complex organism consisting of different parts that each has its functions. Just like the human body, each part of the organism must function well together to survive. Durkheim described this as organic solidarity. Traditional societies exhibit mechanical solidarity. In other words, there is interdependence through similarity. Under Feudalism, societies are highly socially integrated. In layman's terms, there are not many differences between individuals, and people would perceive themselves as a part of society rather than special individuals. In modern societies, the decrease importance of traditional thinking results in a weaker common consciousness. <br>
    What sociological functions does religion fulfill? (structural-functionalism >> what function do certain institutions play in maintaining social solidarity or social structure)<br>
    -	Strengths social cohesion and supports social regulation >> lower suicide rates <br>
    -	Repairs social ties between people when they have been harmed. (eg. mourning) <br>
    Durkheim believed that religion is a product of society. In the modern world, we may develop new belief systems that fulfill traditional religions' functions fulfilled in the past.

<h2>Max Weber </h2>
<p>Key ideas: Value-free research, social action, ideal type, authority, rationalization</p>
<h3>Rationalization: The Disenchantment of Modernity</h3>
<p>Many great thinkers try to capture the essential characteristics of modernity and the idea of progress. What is the most significant change between the world we live in right now and the world hundreds of years ago? Marx may argue that it was the epic shift from Feudalism to Capitalism. Max Weber would say otherwise. Weber studied ideas like rationalization and bureaucracy, and he was concerned about modernity. <br>
    In today's western world, the legal system, educational system, hospitals, or even the DMV all depend on the principles of modern bureaucracy. To become an official in a professional setting, an individual must have specialized education to obtain the relative background or diploma. We must take standardized exams that are approved by the state or the industry. One key characteristic of today's professional world is that we must separate professional life from personal life.  When a professional gives preferential treatment to anyone for whatever reason, this is immediately labeled as corruption or at least frowned upon. Another critical characteristic of bureaucracy is the existence of rules and laws. Officials are trained to follow the rules with no questions asked, and they are not allowed to improvise under normal circumstances. Often we see that people have to suppress their emotions and impulses to do the job well. The chain of command must be followed, and an order is an order. <br>
    Weber believed that the bureaucratic system is one of the greatest inventions of mankind. It is a highly logical or goal-oriented way of approaching problems. However, Weber also warns his readers about the downsides of bureaucracy. The professionals are becoming too calculating and cold-hearted. Unlike Marx's ideas, Weber believed that the problems due to bureaucracy have nothing to do with the rise of capitalism. They are the outcomes of rationalization. </p>
<h3>Weberian Value-Free Research </h3>
<p>The word value-free means a lack of personal bias or opinions toward a subject. Weber's theories about value-free research have been a long-lasting debate in social sciences. </p>
<h3>Relevance: What role does value play in research? </h3>
<p>Weber reasoned that it is not possible to be value-free in every step of the research process. It is the value that drives researchers to study a specific problem. There is nothing wrong with studying capitalism or communism because one believes that one system is superior. When a researcher is forming the research question, the question is developed based on their personal values and theoretical positions. A Marxist would approach a social problem by examing the conflict between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie and how the working class can overthrow the authority via revolution. There are some inherent biases when a researcher explicitly states their theoretical positions, which are not likely to be avoided. </p>
<p>However,  during the data collection and interpretation process, a researcher must be as objective as possible and not manipulate the data in a way that aligns with one's personal beliefs. It is crucial to minimize the biases created by your own preferences.  The best way to do so is to ask researchers from other disciplines to double-check your research process from a neutral and objective perspective. </p>
<h3>Social Action</h3>
<p>Weber defines sociology as the study of social action. The word social indicates the action is directed toward other members of the society. Weber tried to incorporate elements from both humanities and natural sciences into sociology. Humanity studies leverage observations and qualitative research to understand the perspective of other humans. Natural science, on the other hand, discerns chains of cause and effect leveraging statistics and numbers. The combination of quantitative and qualitative approaches characterize the style of research that Weber favors. </p>
<h3>Ideal Types</h3>
<p>An Ideal Type includes all the essential traits of reality. </p>
<p>Four ideal types of social action in pristine form </p>
<p>1. Goal-rational.
The means are selected that will lead to a specific goal in a calculated way. For instance, engineers solve problems by using scientific facts, tested models, and systems. One should always keep their emotions or personal feelings under control. </p>
<p>2. Value-rational.
For example, a person sacrifices his life for the greater good. The action itself is not directed toward a specific material goal but for the sake of certain values like honor or heroism. </p>
<p>3. Affective.
The action is motivated by the emotional state of the actor. </p>
<p>4. Traditional.
The ends and means of actions are fixed by custom and tradition. "We have always done it this way." </p>
<p>Weber argues that in modern Western societies, the realm of goal-rational social action is constantly increasing at the expense of the other three social actions. </p>
<h3>Three ideal types of authority </h3>
<p>Charismatic authority – founded on the belief in the extraordinary deviation, the holiness, the heroic powers. >> Affective Social Action <br>
    Traditional authority – willingly obey someone because they believe in traditional rules (e.g., churches, families, royal families).  >> Traditional Social Action <br>
    Rational legal authority – legal laws, reasonable punishment. >> Goal-Rational Social Action 
    </p>
<p>Weber believed that the realm of rational-legal authority is increasing in contemporary society. He argued that rationalization is the defining feature of modernity rather than the rise of capitalism. Rationalization is about calculability, methodical behavior, and reflexivity. There is nothing fundamentally evil about rationalization itself. However, it is very easy for humans to stop reflecting on the meaning of their work and stuck in a mechanical and repetitive state that Marx would describe as a process of alienation. When that happens, we become a chain of meaningless interactions based on rationalized rules with no personal meaning or feelings behind them. </p>
